# Definition App

An app for storing and accessing company specific phrases

## Installation

### A note of caution!

Whilst Definition implements the Slack oAuth flow, this is purely to support Enterprise Grid Installations. You should *not* install it on multiple public workspaces as the code does *not* make a distinction between workspaces when retrieving terms. Any user can access *any* term/definition pair in the system.
